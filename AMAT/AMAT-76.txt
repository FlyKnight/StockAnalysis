As the situation has evolved over the past several months, our actions at Applied Materials have been guided by two key principles; first, maintaining the trust of our employees, customers, suppliers and partners; and second, focusing on driving initiatives that will allow us to emerge stronger over the longer term.In our factories, labs and logistics centers, we've changed physical layouts to allow for social distancing, introduced enhanced cleaning and sanitation procedures, implemented health screenings and mandated the use of personal protective equipment.
