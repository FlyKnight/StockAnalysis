For these employees supporting our critical operations, we've implemented safeguards to protect them, including more PPE, increasing social distancing, and enhanced sanitization, and we've provided them with additional incentives and benefits to allow for continuity during this very difficult time.Through our organic investments and acquisitions of Hittite and LTC, ADI is a very different company than we were a decade ago, with more diversity, a broader portfolio across high-performance Analog, Power and RF, and higher exposure to more profitable and durable end markets.
