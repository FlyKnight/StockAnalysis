After looking at Cerner Corporation's (NasdaqGS:CERN) latest earnings announcement (28 December 2019), I found it useful to revisit the company's performance in the past couple of years and assess this against the most recent figures.Typically companies that endure a prolonged period of reduction in earnings are undergoing some sort of reinvestment phase with the aim of keeping up with the recent industry growth and disruption.
