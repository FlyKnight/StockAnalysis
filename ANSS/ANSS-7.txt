Several valuable tool improvements have been identified and implemented over the last years of collaboration, for example, related to distinction between transient and permanent faults and import and allocation of design data," said Dr. Rolf Schlagenhaft, senior automotive functional safety professional and assessor, NXP Semiconductors Germany GmbH.Additionally, modeling thermal behavior of batteries during all stages of the design cycle is now easier than ever by using a streamlined workflow and new capabilities that simulate the important effects of capacity fade and cell life.
