"Discovery equips our team with a much better understanding of the physics behind our products very early in the design process, enabling them to meet customer requirements more precisely, avoid overengineering and eliminate uncertainties," said Stefan Macho, head of R&D Simulation, HAWE Hydraulik."This enables engineers to bring simulation upfront in the ideation and design phase of product development, uncovering risks early before the costs to correct them become high or difficult to change."
