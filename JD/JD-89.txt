As we mentioned on our last earnings call, JD.com and its heroic 200,000-strong frontline employees have been a unique force in supporting the livelihood of hundreds of millions of consumers, helping them to adapt to a new normal under the social distancing measures and making notable contributions to productive and sustainable society throughout the COVID-19 crisis.Another positive contribution to the fulfilled gross margin was from JD Logistics, where the productivity gains from higher-than-expected orders more than offset the additional costs from the operational disruptions, higher wages and staff protective measures.
