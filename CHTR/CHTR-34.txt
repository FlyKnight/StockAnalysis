By Helen Coster May 20 (Reuters) - HBO Max, the forthcoming streaming service from AT&T Inc-owned WarnerMedia, announced on Wednesday several new partners will carry its content, but it has not yet announced deals with Comcast Corp, Amazon.com Inc or Roku Inc. HBO Max will be available on Altice USA Inc, Cox Communications, Microsoft Corp, National Cable Television Cooperative (NCTC), Samsung, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Verizon Communications Inc when it launches on May 27, the company said.HBO Max is launching at a time when demand for new content is high - as more people are staying home due to the coronavirus - but consumers' income may have taken a hit as a result of the pandemic.
