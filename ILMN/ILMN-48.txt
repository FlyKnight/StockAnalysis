I talked a little bit about the work that Professor Bedford was doing out at the Fred Hutch in Seattle, Charles Chiu at UCSF, really we've seen our researchers really jump all in to help us combat the pandemic and understand the mutations in the virus, the transmission vectors and the host response.If this disruption persist and I don't want to give you a certain number of months or a very specific timeframe, but if this -- if we believe that these work -- shelter-in-place, work-from-home restrictions will continue for definitely Q3 and beyond, then we have got contingency plans that we have put in place that require us to be much more, I would say, look at cutting expenses in a much more significant way and that would involve things like pausing hiring altogether.
