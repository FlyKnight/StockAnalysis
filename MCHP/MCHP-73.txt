Our Philippines operations had the largest impact with restriction on people movement being so strict that we have had a large number of our dedicated employees living in our two factories there since mid-March to support production and improve customer shipments.We believe the backlog position compared to March quarter will continue to deteriorate due to the combined effects of supply chain disruptions, customer factory closures and demand destruction.
