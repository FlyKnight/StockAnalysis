Our Philippines operations had the largest impact with restriction on people movement being so strict that we have had a large number of our dedicated employees living in our 2 factories there since mid-March to support production and improve customer shipments.With economies around the world contracting rapidly, with millions of people getting laid off and with customer factory closures due to shelter in place ordinances in various countries, we believe that product demand is likely to weaken significantly.
