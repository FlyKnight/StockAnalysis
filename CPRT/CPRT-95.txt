In its third-quarter securities filing, the social-media behemoth doubled down on an assertion it has made for years: “We do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.” The company said that it plans to retain future earnings “to finance the operation and expansion of our business and fund our share-repurchase program.” In the first nine months of 2019, Facebook repurchased about $3 billion of its class A common stock.“But beyond that,” CEO Michael Mahoney said at a conference in May, corporate cash use is “really going to be on smart M&A and share repurchase as you look out over that kind of three- or four-year period.”  To wit: In August, Boston Scientific closed a $4 billion acquisition of BTG, a London-based health-care firm.
