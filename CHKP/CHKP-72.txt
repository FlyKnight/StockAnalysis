Zoom Video Communications Inc. shares stumbled Monday after one analyst downgraded the stock, joining a backlash against the videoconferencing company as it deals with an unprecedented surge of users stuck at home amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Credit Suisse analyst Brad Zelnick downgraded Zoom to an underperform rating from neutral Monday and raised his price target to $105 from $95, on the basis that “the current share price embeds significantly greater conversion of free users than our upside model scenario.”  “We commend Zoom for being a superhero of the current health crisis, though our responsibility as equity analysts compels us to distinguish great companies from great stocks,” Zelnick said.
