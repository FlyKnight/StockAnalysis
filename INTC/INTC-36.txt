Intel  (INTC) - Get Report announced the departure of Chief Engineering Officer Murthy Renduchintala, less than a week after the chip giant said its new 7-nanometer processor, a key component in its strategy to take on market-leading rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor  (TSM) - Get Report, was around six months behind schedule and that it might have to seek outside help in order to catch up.Intel CEO Bob Swan said last week that chips made with the company's 7nm-based CPU technology were expected to launch in 2021 but would be delayed due to a flaw that resulted in "yield degradation" in its manufacturing process.
