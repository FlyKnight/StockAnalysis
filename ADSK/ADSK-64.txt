I think the one anomaly, and we talked about this in the opening commentary, was in Media and Entertainment, which actually showed a slight decline for the quarter year-on-year and that was really driven by one large multiyear upfront transaction that was done in Q4 a year ago that skewed that.And we sort of glossed over it, given all the other news that's in the environment, but I'm pretty proud of the fact that we hit the number that we laid out 3 years ago for free cash flow at the end of fiscal '21, which was no small task given the amount of transition we still had to go through and the changes we made in execution to get there.
