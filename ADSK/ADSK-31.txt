Ahead of the results, five-star RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg has set out his earnings preview, while reiterating a buy rating and $205 price target (3% upside potential).Investor sentiment is veering towards the low-side heading into earnings, says Hedberg, but he “continues to believe ADSK remains well-positioned to deliver on its FY/23 guidance benefiting from multiple drivers…and time.” From the analyst’s reseller survey, he notes strong renewal trends and an uptick in 360 usage (particularly BIM360 Design), offset by challenges to new business and shorter contract duration.
