Customers affected by COVID-19 pandemic encouraged to contact ComEd as soon as possible to explore flexible assistance options As people continue to feel the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, ComEd is voluntarily extending until at least July 1, 2020, its support for these customers by suspending disconnections and waiving new late payment charges and reconnection fees."As the state carries out its plan to reopen businesses in a safe and responsible way, we recognize that it may be some time before many of our customers can get back on their feet," said ComEd CEO Joe Dominguez.
