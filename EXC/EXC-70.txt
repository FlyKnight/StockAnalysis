On Feb. 27, ComEd hosted an elite assembly of engineering researchers and practitioners to discuss quantum computing and its practical applications for distributed energy resources in the smart grid of the future.Quantum computers could prove to be more powerful than conventional supercomputers in solving specialized problems, including modeling a "smart grid" that draws from renewable resources such as solar panels and geothermal generators.
