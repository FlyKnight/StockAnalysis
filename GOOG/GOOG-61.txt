(Bloomberg) -- Before Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg signed a deal to acquire Instagram, he proposed the idea to the photo-sharing startup’s co-founder Kevin Systrom, who was not interested.The Instagram purchase, for $715 million in 2012, was “exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that antitrust laws were intended to prevent,” Representative Jerrold Nadler told Zuckerberg at a hearing Wednesday.
