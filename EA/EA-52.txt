EA reached an exclusive licensing deal for Star Wars games with Walt Disney (DIS) in 2013.Interestingly, EA said its multi-player mode will offer cosmetic and gameplay customization options that “are earned solely through gameplay.” The company’s prior multi-player Star Wars game, Battlefront 2 in 2017, was initially criticized for a heavy focus on selling loot crates that gave players a random chance at coveted items.
