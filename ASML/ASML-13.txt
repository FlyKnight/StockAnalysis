The latest technological advances in this segment allow chipmakers to continually increase the number of transistors on the same area of silicon, with lithography historically representing a meaningful portion of the cost of making cutting-edge chips.Chipmakers will require next-generation EUV lithography tools that have been in development by ASML to continue past the 10-nanometer process node.
