With its advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) system, the eSL10 employs deep learning algorithms that adapt to IC manufacturers' evolving inspection requirements, isolating the defects most critical to device performance.Three-dimensional device architectures – such as 3D NAND and DRAM for memory, and finFET and gate all around (GAA) transistors for logic – are requiring fabs to rethink traditional defect control strategies.
