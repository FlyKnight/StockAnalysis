The industry is still cyclical, but this past year, Applied Materials earned about five times as much per share as it did at the bottom of the most recent slump for chip equipment spending, in fiscal 2013.Over the mid- to long term, profits for the chip-equipment group will be driven by continued silicon proliferation, growing services revenue, and a rising intensity of spending on machines, as chips reach the limits of miniaturization and shift to advanced architectures for performance gains.
