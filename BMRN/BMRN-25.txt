These 3 tenants, infused with the talents of the most dedicated people I've ever worked with, have consistently enabled us to take research ideas rapidly through development, navigating the complexity of the regulatory approval process in a highly effective and differentiated manner to meet the needs of patients.I am confident and committed that the transition in technical operations at BioMarin from me to Greg will build on the legacy of science, compliance and ingenuity, for our patients that will benefit from the products that will emerge from our efforts, for our employees and their careers, and for our shareholders as we become profitable.
