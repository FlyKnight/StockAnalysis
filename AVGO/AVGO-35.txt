In a report June 16, Mizuho Securities managing director Vijay Rakesh wrote that both Qualcomm and Broadcom “offer solid opportunities” in the “multiyear 5G ramp ahead.” KeyBanc managing director John Vinh in a report June 15 included both companies among his “favorite ideas.” Broadcom trades at a forward P/E of 13.9, but analysts expect its sales to grow at a pace of 6% in its next full fiscal year and 5% the year after — considerably slower than Qualcomm’s.Broadcom famously launched a hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm, which was ended after President Trump issued an executive order in March 2018 to bar a possible combination of the companies on national security grounds.
