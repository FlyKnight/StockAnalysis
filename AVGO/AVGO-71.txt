(Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc., a chipmaker that supplies Apple Inc. and other large electronics makers, gave a lackluster forecast, as weak demand for smartphone parts overshadowed rising orders from data center owners.Revenue in the three months ended in July will be $5.75 billion, plus or minus $150 million.Tan explained that his “large North American smartphone customer” -- typically how he refers to Apple -- is undergoing a “product cycle delay.” That means the usual improvement in wireless-related orders that comes in the company’s fiscal third quarter, which runs through July, will now be seen in the following three-month period.
