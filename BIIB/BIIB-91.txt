The New Jersey-based biotech is set to launch a two-step, phase 2 and 3 trial of the leukemia drug PTC299 in the United States, with additional tests requested in Spain and filings planned in Europe, Brazil and Australia, according to an article in FierceBiotech.CEO Stuart Peltz said that by inhibiting a specific human enzyme called DHODH, PTC299 uniquely addresses the two key issues of Covid-19, namely reducing the high viral replication and also selectively lessening the immune response caused by the uncontrolled cytokine storm resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
