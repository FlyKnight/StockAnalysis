(See BIIB stock analysis on TipRanks) On July 8 Biogen announced that it had completed its biologics license application (BLA) regulatory submission for aducanumab, an investigational human monoclonal antibody for Alzheimer’s disease- and requested priority review.“That said, this does not change our view on the candidate’s approval prospects, which we currently see as little better than a coin flip” the analyst wrote, adding that “with mounting pressures to the core franchises lowering BIIB’s perceived floor valuation, everything appears to be riding on this single, controversial asset.” As a result he reiterated a Hold rating on Biogen.
