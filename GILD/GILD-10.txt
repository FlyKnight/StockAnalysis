“When stocks pull back as the contest draws near, then rebounds as it comes to pass, the median move has been around 9% in both directions,” writes Calvasina, “In years where the stock market rallies ahead of the election, then pulls back as the event passes, rallies tend to be robust heading in while declines that follow tend be around 5%.”  Still, any sharp movements after the election might prove to be short lived, she says.In 2000, for instance, when it took five weeks to settle the race between George W. Bush and Al Gore, the S&P 500 reversed its upward trend in the previous month and fell 12% from the election day to its late December low.
