If Gilead doesn't win regulatory approval for its key treatment candidates, particularly filgotinib, its growth prospects would be seriously dented.With a dividend that's currently yielding close to 3.5% thrown into the mix, my view is that the biotech will deliver market-beating total returns over the next decade.
