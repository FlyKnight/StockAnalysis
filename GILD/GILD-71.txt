On July 10, Gilead announced comparative analysis results from its phase 3 clinical trial investigating remdesivir's efficacy in critically ill patients with COVID-19.With 14% of COVID-19 patients developing severe symptoms and 5% requiring intensive care, I expect Gilead and its stock to be amply rewarded for producing a lifesaving treatment.
