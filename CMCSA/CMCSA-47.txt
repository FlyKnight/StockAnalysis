Many of the companies that I follow, including Union Pacific (UNP), Starbucks (SBUX), Comcast (CMCSA) and Nike (NKE), reported results that seemed unfathomable at the start of the year and in many cases were worse than what they experienced during the financial crisis.For those that agree with Mr. Market, I think it's fair to say Berkshire missed its chance - and to take it a step further, that their ability to capitalize upon dislocation going forward has been permanently impaired due to factors such as the increasing willingness of governments to come to the rescue of (often debt-ridden) big businesses, both in terms of monetary and fiscal policy.
