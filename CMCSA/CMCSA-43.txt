MILAN, July 23 (Reuters) - Clubs in Italy's Serie A soccer league will meet next week to discuss investor bids for their media business, with an array of international funds expected to join the race, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.Private equity firms CVC, Bain Capital, Advent International, TPG, Apollo and General Atlantic were invited to submit bids by Friday but one of the sources said the deadline had been pushed back to Monday to give investors more time to detail proposals.
