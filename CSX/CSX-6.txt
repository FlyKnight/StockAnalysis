We will never be satisfied with the performance if any of our employees get injured while at work and we are undertaking a comprehensive safety engagement initiative this quarter focused on strengthening critical rules compliance and systemically identifying and eliminating unsafe acts.The topics of ESG and driving positive social impact are critically important to CSX, our customers and the communities we serve and we look forward to providing additional detail on key initiatives in our sustainability report to be released later this month.
