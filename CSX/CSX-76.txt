At the May 1 high, this reading was 91.05, with the level above 90.00 putting the stock into an "inflating parabolic bubble" that popped following the July 16 disappointing earnings report.My theory is that nine years of volatility between closes are enough to assume that all possible bullish or bearish events for the stock are factored in.
