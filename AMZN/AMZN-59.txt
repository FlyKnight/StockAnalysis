(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In a historic session Wednesday, the CEOs of four of the world’s biggest technology giants appeared before a House subcommittee to answer wide-ranging questions about their anticompetitive practices and allegations they leveraged their powerful platforms to harm competitors.A look at the Department of Justice’s website reveals that the principles behind antitrust regulation are centered on promoting fair competition and benefiting consumers through “lower prices, better quality and greater choice.” A breakup would help achieve most of those aims.
