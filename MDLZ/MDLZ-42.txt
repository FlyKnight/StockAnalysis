Swiss food giant Nestle (NSRGY), which paid $7.2 billion in 2018 to sell packaged Starbucks coffee and tea, remains the top player worldwide, but Peetâ€™s ranks second in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, Howard noted, and third in Latin America.Starbucks is dominant but its market share is less than 40%, according to Howard, compared with 70% in the U.S. Chinese rival Luckin Coffee (LK) has thousands of stores and posted strong growth over the past few years, but it has been struggling with accounting scandals and a potential Nasdaq-delisting.
