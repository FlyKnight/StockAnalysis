As noted yesterday, Wall Street likes the idea of consolidation in food delivery, a business largely dominated by four players—Grubhub, Uber Eats, and two venture-backed companies, DoorDash and Postmates, both of which have filed confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission for initial public offerings.Guggenheim’s Matthew DiFrisco writes that he had previously estimated that a deal for Grubhub could be worth $72 to $83 a share, but that projection predated the Covid-19 pandemic, which has hurt its business in New York City, the company’s most important market.
