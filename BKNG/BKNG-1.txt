During Trivago’s earnings call Wednesday, Chief Financial Officer Matthias Tillmann said during March and April, some of its partners ceased advertising with the company, and others significantly reduced their campaigns.“Booking Holdings and their sub-brands (like Booking.com and Agoda) have kept all of their campaigns live throughout the quarter, and have been actually one of the first to adjust the bids upwards when they felt that cancellation rates were under more control and volumes were picking up,” Tillmann said.
