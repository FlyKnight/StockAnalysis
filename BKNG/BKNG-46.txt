The Airbnb co-founder said he hopes that the settlement and host-information transfers would reassure the city and state “that short-term rentals can be effectively regulated without blunt prohibitions.” “Now more than ever, regular New Yorkers should have the ability to occasionally share their home, activity that we believe should not be confused with illegal hotels,” Blecharczyk said.Update: Vijay Dandapani, CEO of the Hotel Association of New York City, told Skift Monday he thinks “Airbnb got off very lightly and this [the settlement] do nearly enough to stop illegal activity.” Among Dandapani’s objections, he said compliance verification is up to the Office of Special Enforcement, which is “already buried under reams of data from subpoenas high they have not even gotten to.” Other weaknesses in the settlement include a “measly”quarterly penalty of $1,500 for not reporting information, and enabling Airbnb to bring further legal action against future laws, he said.
