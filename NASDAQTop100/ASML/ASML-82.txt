By Toby Sterling VELDHOVEN, NETHERLANDS (Reuters) - Semiconductor equipment maker ASML Holding NV on Wednesday forecast double digit growth in sales and profits for 2020, saying it did not expect any financial impact from being swept up in the trade war between the United States and China.Reuters reported earlier this month that the delay came after a campaign of pressure from the Trump administration to stop China getting hold of a machine required to make the world's fastest microprocessors, but which also has military applications.
