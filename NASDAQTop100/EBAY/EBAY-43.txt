On Wednesday, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Edward Yruma reiterated his Overweight rating on eBay shares, lifting his target price to $65 from $58.His view is that the classifieds deal sets the stage to “restart long-term Marketplace growth.” Yruma expects eBay to post 23% to 26% second-quarter gross merchandise value, asserting that growth in new sellers, consumer-facing improvements, and new payment options “should serve as long-term tailwinds for the business.” He thinks eBay has regained lost market share during the Covid-19 pandemic and eventually should grow at rates exceeding overall e-commerce growth “as it both improves its consumer offering and takes advantage of stronger secular trends.”  A weekly guide to our best stories on technology, disruption, and the people and stocks in the middle of it all.
