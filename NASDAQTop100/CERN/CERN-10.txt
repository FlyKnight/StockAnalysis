“After comprehensive planning and alignment between our two organizations, we are confident that teaming with Cerner to achieve a fully integrated revenue cycle platform will meet our business needs now and into the future,” said Dennis Laraway, CFO, Banner Health.“Building on our past successful collaborations with Cerner for mainly clinical applications, adoption of their revenue cycle management solution is now a critical next step to streamline both clinical and financial solutions for our patients across the entire Banner Health enterprise.” This expansion is expected to better position Banner Health to flexibly adapt to new payment structures, more quickly adjust to policy and compliance changes, better coordinate single registration between acute and ambulatory services and centralize single-source patient charting and reporting across multiple care locations.
