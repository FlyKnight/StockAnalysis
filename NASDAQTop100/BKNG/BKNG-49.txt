Tripadvisor published a white paper this week on expected stages in a travel recovery, and stated the company sees “clear signs of pent up consumer demand based on sentiment and search activity.” But in a research note Monday, Evercore ISI’s Lee Horowitz and colleagues wrote that the global travel recovery, which has been driven by strength in North America, particularly for alternative accommodations, “has hit a near-term plateau.” “Other regions like Europe have begun to display better recovery strength … while other products like OTAs (online travel agencies) airlines, metasearch properties, and tours and activities platforms have shown better relative performance through the start of June,” Horowitz said.Speaking of North America, Horowitz argued that there will be a “long and challenging road ahead toward a full travel recovery.” Note: Skift CEO Rafat Ali has a seat on Discover Puerto Rico’s advisory board.
