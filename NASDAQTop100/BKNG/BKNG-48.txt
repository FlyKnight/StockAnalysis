“As separately described in correspondence with Booking.com’s Partner Services representatives, we aim to continue to enable you to offer your supply via Booking.com through our strategic partnerships and look forward to displaying your attractions in the future,” the Booking.com notice said in a addition to the termination disclosure.“My recommendation to those suppliers is to choose your partners very carefully and work with truly independent booking software providers with extensive distribution.” Asked to comment on Musement sharing business leads with Booking.com’s FareHarbor, TUI spokesman Martin Riecken declined to answer, and instead commented: “We are open to onboarding additional FareHarbor suppliers that are relevant to both Booking.com and Amusement/TUI, and distribute them through our channels.” Will the transition from direct contracts with Booking.com to pacts with Musement instead include a new business model or terms?
