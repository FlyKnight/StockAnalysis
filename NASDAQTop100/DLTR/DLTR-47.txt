Chris, I've flown on the Boeing 737 MAX many times, I'm a Southwest customer, I am not a skittish guy, but until independent people tell me that these software glitches have been fixed, I'm not getting on it.Not a lot of people are flying for no reason, so I can't imagine there's that much wear-and-tear on airplanes or that companies are going to be looking to bolster their fleets, especially with high capacity planes; that doesn't make a ton of sense right now.
