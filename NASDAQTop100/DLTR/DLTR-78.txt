Consumers’ renewed focus on value amid a time of historic unemployment and economic uncertainty might seem like a slam dunk for dollar stores.“The broad consumables offering, low prices (even if somewhat higher than Walmart’s [ticker: WMT] on a per-unit basis), and convenient locations (that save miles driven) was increasingly appreciated by a larger swath of the U.S. population at that time.” So it isn’t a stretch to think the companies will see another boost this year, as the Covid-19 pandemic crimps spending power and has put millions of Americans out of work.
