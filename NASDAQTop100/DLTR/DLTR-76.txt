Deutsche analyst Paul Trussell takes a look at the group ahead of soon-to-be-released earnings reports, writing that there have been two schools of thought for the stocksâ€”either that they would get a boost from shoppers focused on low prices, or they would see declines as consumers consolidate their trips at big, one-stop-shopping locations and online retailers.He notes that while valuation may be a concern for some Five Below investors, and Dollar Tree remains a polarized stock in need of a strong report, he thinks they will ultimately prevail and reward shareholders.
