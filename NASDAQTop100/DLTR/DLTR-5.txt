The Strike for Black Lives, organized by the Service Employees International Union, called for workers to hold a moment of silence in their workplace for 8 minutes and 46 seconds–the amount of time a Minnesota police officer allegedly kneeled on George Floyd’s neck during his fatal arrest–or, if possible, to leave work.Rep. Donna Shalala (D., Fla.) said in an interview with ABC News that given there is still clear community spread in the state, where new cases emerge that cannot be traced to exposure to a specific infected person, it’s “ridiculous” to push to opening schools as usual.
