Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.And then on the COVID expense side, you called out some of the initial labor cost you expect into 2Q, I was hoping to understand if there is additional kind of PP&E safety equipment run rate that we should be factoring in here and how normal and ongoing that would be?
