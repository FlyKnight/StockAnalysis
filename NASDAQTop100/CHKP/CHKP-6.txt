So, I'd like once again to thank you for joining this Zoom session today and thank all our customers, partners, employees, and new investors and analysts that are making the impossible happen and helping us deliver our vision of living in a connected and safe world.But are there any observations you can share from a refresh perspective, specifically is there any reason to think that just given the disruption in the world that customers might be sweating their assets and taking longer to update their hardware?
