While acknowledging that U.S. trade and technology IP policy decisions with regards to Huawei could cloud this year's visibility, the analyst expects both factors will have modest impact on TSMC's longer term prospects as it adapts to a diverse and growing global customer base including NVIDIA, Apple, and AMD.By outsourcing leading edge technology, presumably to TSMC, INTC would give up what has been its main source of competitive advantage for 50 years and compete only on architecture, which we donâ€™t think is enough to maintain the dominant market share and premium margins that are now expected.
