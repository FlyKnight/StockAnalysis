Meanwhile, demand for TSMC's chips among its top customers should remain stable this year, as analysts expect several tailwinds -- including Apple's new iPhones and AMD's new chipsets for the PS5 and Xbox Series X -- to boost its revenue and earnings 15% and 24%, respectively.But if I had to pick one over the other, I'd stick with TSMC for its market-leading position in contract manufacturing, diverse customer base of tech titans, stable growth rates, and decent dividend.
