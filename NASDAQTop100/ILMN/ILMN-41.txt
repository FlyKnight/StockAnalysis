Before concluding my initial remarks, I think it's worth noting that while most of our time and energy today is being spent on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our traditional customers who are working on diverse areas, including human biomedical research and plant and animal sciences, have made tremendous progress using PacBio tools and products in the past several months, generating the most accurate and comprehensive genomes in their respective fields.As the pandemic hits, you were just about to progress with broader commercial efforts with presumably additional hiring, and while managing cash makes sense, on the other hand, you also want to be ready to play some support instruments when things do get back to normal and once everything starts to look encouraging.
