This is especially true as chipmaker giant Analog Devices ADI plans to acquire rival semiconductor Maxim Integrated Products MXIM for $21 billion in an all-stock deal.It would likely require approval from regulators in the United States, China and the European Union.The deal, which is expected to close in the summer of 2021, would create a competitor to Texas Instruments TXN, the leader in analog semiconductors with a $119 billion market value.
