(Reuters) - Semiconductor maker Analog Devices Inc said on Monday it would buy rival Maxim Integrated Products Inc for about $21 billion in the largest U.S. deal this year, aimed at boosting its market share in automotive and 5G chipmaking.ADI Chief Executive Vincent Roche told Reuters in an interview the combined engineering teams would help the resulting company design more specialized, higher-margin chips for customers such as automakers.
