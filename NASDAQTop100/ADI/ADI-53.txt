Five-star analyst Rick Schafer at Oppenheimer recently reiterated a Buy rating on Analog’s stock with a $140 price target (12% upside potential), saying that he applauds management’s proactive cost control efforts, and structural growth opportunities in 5G RAN.“The medical, defense, and 5G RAN offer a hedge against potential downside risk in GDP-sensitive auto and broad industrial segments.” Schafer added that looking ahead to CY21 and beyond, he likes ADI’s 5G-led structural growth/margin profile.
