The false-claims charges filed by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, Andrew Lelling, say that Regeneron executives discussed how the companyâ€™s donations to a co-pay charity called the Chronic Disease Fund would yield a fourfold return on investment by boosting demand and allowing a higher price for Eylea.The Chronic Disease Fund settled a separate anti-kickback case brought by the federal government in 2019 concerning co-pay programs for Dendreon, Astellas Pharma, Novartis, the Amgen unit Onyx Pharmaceuticals, and the Mallinckrodt subsidiary Questcor.
