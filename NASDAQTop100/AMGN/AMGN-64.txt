This molecular couple, the FLT3 receptor and its ligand, has a key role in the development of blood cells that are important in both acute myeloid leukemia and immune responses."This report describes a novel major risk gene for several autoimmune diseases, discovered through a genome-wide study on autoimmune thyroid disease, and how the risk variant affects the gene product, FLT3, and consequently the level of the ligand to the FLT3 receptor in blood, thereby demonstrating its functional importance," says Prof. Saedis Saevarsdottir, scientist at deCODE genetics and first author on the paper "The discoveries presented in this paper are based on the sequential application of genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics; the combination of these three omics in a hypothesis independent manner yields a remarkably powerful approach to the study of human disease," says Kari Stefansson, CEO of deCODE genetics and senior author on the paper.
