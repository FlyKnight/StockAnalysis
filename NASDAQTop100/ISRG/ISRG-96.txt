Piper Sandler analyst Adam Maeder, who affirms an overweight rating on Intuitive Surgical with a $633 price target, said that investors may have been "somewhat surprised and disappointed" with some of the forward-looking commentary on the company's earnings call.While management's profitability commentary could hurt the stock in near term, he said, the company has significantly outperformed analysts' initial revenue and earnings estimates in each of the past three years.
