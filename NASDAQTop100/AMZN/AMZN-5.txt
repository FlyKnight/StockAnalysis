“As expected, we spent over $4 billion on incremental COVID-19-related costs in the quarter to help keep employees safe and deliver products to customers in this time of high demand — purchasing personal protective equipment, increasing cleaning of our facilities, following new safety process paths, adding new backup family-care benefits, and paying a special thank-you bonus of over $500 million to front-line employees and delivery partners.”  The gains in Amazon’s core business show why investors are sticking by Amazon, and more are joining them.In a conference call Thursday afternoon, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky noted that online grocery sales tripled in the quarter and worldwide video streaming doubled from a year ago.
