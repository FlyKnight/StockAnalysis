On Wednesday, and for the first time as a group, the CEOs of four of the biggest technology companies — Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. —  will go before a U.S. House subcommittee to address allegations of monopolistic practices and abusing the power of their platforms to crush or stifle competitors.But out of the group, the remarks of Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai may be the most important, as it is increasingly evident his company will shortly be subject to actions from multiple government entities over Google’s market dominance.
