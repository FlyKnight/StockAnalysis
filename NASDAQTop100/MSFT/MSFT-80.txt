CEO Satya Nadella said as much on the conference call with analysts: Going forward, Xbox with the approach we are taking has much more of an ability to reach the two-plus billion gamers out there and we are in the early days of building that out.With record low interest rates and lots of risk out there across many industries, the safety of having not one, but many, diverse profit centers is what has buoyed large-cap technology stocks like Microsoft, and I expect that trend to continue for the foreseeable future.
