Slack's General Counsel David Schellhase insisted the company "simply wants fair competition and a level playing field," called Teams a "weak, copycat product," and accused Microsoft of illegally leveraging "its power from one market to another" with its software bundles.This makes it tough for Slack to survive a prolonged war against Microsoft, which is firmly profitable, generates most of its revenue from other businesses, and can continue to offer Teams for free at "zero or negative margins."
