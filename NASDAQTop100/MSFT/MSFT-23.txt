(Bloomberg) -- Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai highlighted a long list of digital rivals in his opening statement ahead of Wednesday’s hearing with the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on antitrust.“You can ask Alexa a question from your kitchen; read your news on Twitter; ask friends for information via WhatsApp; and get recommendations on Snapchat or Pinterest.” Competition in digital advertising, from Twitter Inc., Facebook Inc.’s Instagram, Pinterest Inc., Comcast Corp. and others, has helped lower online ad costs by 40% over the last decade, and these savings have been passed down to consumers through lower prices, the CEO added.
