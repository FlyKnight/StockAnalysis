(Bloomberg) -- Shares of technology companies have soared over the past few months, and valuations “have hit a wall,” suggesting there could be limited additional upside over the near term, according to Jefferies.Analyst Brent Thill believes that “at some point multiple expansion will run out, and that the next leg of growth has to come from fundamentals.” While the backdrop for fundamentals “remains strong,” he wrote, expectations are elevated and “investors will need to be patient in the [near term] before the ride commences again.” Last week saw results from Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp., Texas Instruments Inc., Intel Corp., and Snap Inc., all of which fell in response to their reports.
