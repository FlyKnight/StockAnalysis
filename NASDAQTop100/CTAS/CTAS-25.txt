Created to celebrate EVS technicians who don masks and gloves, instead of capes, to work on the frontline of patient care, the program awards $2,500 to eight winners and a $2,500 donation on their behalf to their healthcare institution or charity of their choice."We are proud to partner with Cintas to honor the hard and meaningful work that EVS technicians do on a daily basis, especially during these unprecedented times," said Marta Aebischer, VP Marketing, Rubbermaid Commercial Products.
