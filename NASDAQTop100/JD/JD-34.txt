The Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA) competitor is listing in a secondary market against a backdrop of rising tensions between the United States and China.The U.S. Senate last month passed a bill that threatens Chinese companies with delisting at the country's exchanges if they can't establish that they aren't owned or controlled by a foreign government.
