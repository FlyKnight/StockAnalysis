"These data demonstrate that subcutaneous ULTOMIRIS may offer the same benefits of immediate, complete and sustained complement inhibition as the intravenous formulation, while also providing an additional treatment choice for those who would rather self-administer their medicine," said John Orloff, M.D., Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development at Alexion.Previously approved by the FDA for use with another therapy, the single-use SmartDoseÂ® device contains a pre-filled cartridge and was developed in collaboration with West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. to provide patients with a more flexible ULTOMIRIS treatment option.
