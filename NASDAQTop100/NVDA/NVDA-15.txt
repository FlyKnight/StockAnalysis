American depositary receipts of Taiwan Semiconductor rose 9.7% to close at $73.90 Friday, in part because Intel CEO Bob Swan said on Thursday’s earnings call that the company was willing to hold talks with contractors about hiring a manufacturer for some of its fabrication.Despite the Friday selloff, Intel beat analysts’ earnings expectations for the latest quarter, continues to pay a healthy dividend, and makes billions selling chips that don’t need the next-generation technique to remain viable.
