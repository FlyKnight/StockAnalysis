Advanced Micro Devices Inc. shares headed toward record highs in after-hours trading Tuesday after the chip company reported second-quarter earnings that beat expectations and increased its full-year forecast despite the COVID-19 pandemic.“We do believe that the market is a little bit better than we thought 90 days ago, but we also believe that our product traction is strong, and we’re seeing that with our customer demand, so those are the reasons for the guidance,” Su said on a conference call.
