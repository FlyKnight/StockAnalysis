What a week for investors in semiconductor stocks -- the right ones, that is.On Monday I told the tale of Intel's INTC fall from grace as competitors left it behind in their race to get ever smaller in the nanoscale world of sub-10nm transistor architectures...The Tech Analyst Who Screamed Buy TSM at $50!Last Friday, Intel's pain (-16%) was exactly the gain (+16%) of peer Advanced Micro Devices AMD, who has adopted 7nm technology by outsourcing to the premier Asian foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor TSM.And today the AMD ascendancy to the game of nanometer thrones is complete after the company delivered a stunning quarterly earnings report last night, with unbelievable growth in guidance for the second half.In the video that accompanies this article, I go over the whole story.And I also share a bunch of slides from recent AMD investor presentations that explain why the company is not only en fuego in data centers and gaming -- just like NVIDIA NVDA -- but also in PC and laptop land because they offered what Intel could not in the nano universe.Grow It Like It's SoftwareThis was a powerful "beat and raise" quarter that sent Wall Street into a whirlwind of upgrades and frenzied buying today.
