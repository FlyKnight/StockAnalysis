While the near-term financial numbers were strong, the big story was Intel saying its future lineup of 7-nanometer chips — a new version of the central processing units it makes that serve as the general-purpose operating brains for desktop and server computers  — will be delayed.This in turn enabled Intel’s main competitor, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. — which designs its own semiconductors and pays TSMC to make them — to take market share by offering better-performing and lower-energy consuming chips.
