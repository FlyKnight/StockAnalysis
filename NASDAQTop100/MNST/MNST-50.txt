The strategy, which Goldman calls “Quality-at-a-Reasonable-Price” is part of a larger way of thinking about investing for the “reopening of the economy.” The analysts also recommend avoiding exposure to small businesses, which are likely to be hit hardest by the lockdowns but least likely to benefit from stimulus — and, separately, to consider buying stocks of goods-producing cyclical companies.Look to past ‘waterfalls’ for context The investment bank ran its valuation screen by using a metric of price divided by 2021 earnings per share, or EPS, “given that we expect substantial revisions to consensus 2020 estimates as the impact of the economic shutdown becomes more clear.” They excluded stocks that ranked in the top 20% of valuations in their respective sectors, and then also excluded those in the bottom 20%, to avoid “value traps.” Of note, only four energy companies make it through the screen, and all are in the bottom 10 of Goldman’s 30, and thus not noted above.
