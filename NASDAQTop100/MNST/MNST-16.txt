Known as Hansen's Natural prior to changing its name in 2012 to better reflect its future as an energy drink leader, the company also signed a global distribution deal with Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) a couple of years later.That gives Beyond Meat enough flexibility to pursue its global aspirations, although I expect it will need to look for fresh cash within the next couple of years by issuing more stock (which dilutes existing shareholders) or debt (which lowers profit margins).
