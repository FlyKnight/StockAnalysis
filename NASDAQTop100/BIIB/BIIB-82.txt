Analyst Carter Gould lowered his rating on Biogen (ticker: BIIB) to Equal Weight from Overweight, and shaved $90 off his price target to $280.Given that his conviction in aducanumab “has waned in the wake of delays, a lack of clarity around points of discussion with Food and Drug Administration, and a seemingly less confident stance,” he thinks it is wise to move to the sidelines “even with the meaningful upside and narrative shift that could come with potential aducanumab success.” This weekend, Barron’s argued that Biogen might be the rare stock where a waiting in the wings approach makes sense.
