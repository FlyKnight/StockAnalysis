Farfetch also owns Stadium Goods, one of the largest online marketplaces for premium sneakers, and New Guards Group, which manufactures and distributes luxury streetwear brands, such as Off-White, Heron Preston, and Palm Angels.Similar to many upstarts, Farfetch has plowed all of its resources into growth, which has pressured near-term profitability, but management expects to reach positive adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) by fiscal 2021.
