F5 Networks FFIV recently announced a new deal with Rakuten Mobile, per which the former will support the latter’s next-generation "operator enabling platform” — Rakuten Communications Platform (RCP) — with its wide range of application security services.In April, Rakuten Mobile’s commercial mobile carrier service was introduced, which will be backed by F5 networks, aiding Rakuten Mobile’s efforts in agile application development in a multi-cloud environment.This partnership will offer accelerated and cost-efficient deployment of fully virtualized cloud-native telco edge services to telecommunication companies worldwide.F5 Networks holds a major position in the application delivery controller (ADC) market as its products are important components for data center consolidation, virtualization and cloud services.Also, Cisco’s CSCO decision to shift focus from the core ADC market has helped F5 Networks capture considerable market share.Notably, in May, the company launched new solutions to give customers end-to-end visibility into the health and performance of applications, and provide integrated traffic, security and API management controls to regulate the applications.
