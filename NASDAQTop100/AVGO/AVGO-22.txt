Despite the fact that its high-growth days have long been in the rearview mirror, investing in telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) continues to be one the safest ways for income-seeking and conservative investors to make a buck.The company's projected payout ratio of around 65% in 2020 is right in that sweet spot where a cut is highly unlikely (especially with AT&T continuing to unload noncore assets and reduce its debt), but shareholders are still netting a significant portion of total income.
