As a result, we expect moderation in the year-over-year margin comparisons in the second half of the year as we invest in several key initiatives for the Company, including the G7 clinical trials, G7 manufacturing scale-up, our new market efforts and direct-to-consumer advertising that we began to accelerate late in the second quarter.Our team has done a great job to execute on our goal of doubling G6 capacity in the first half of 2020 despite an extraordinarily difficult and unanticipated operating environment putting the Company in its best position since the launch of G6 to meet the many opportunities in front of us and we now look forward to replicating that momentum with the scale-up of our G7 lines.
