The FDA has finally cleared the FreeStyle Libre 2 integrated continuous glucose monitoring (iCGM) system from Abbott (NYSE:ABT) for type 1 diabetes patients 4 and older.Over the past couple of years, another iCGM, the G6 from Dexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM), has gained significant popularity, partly because its Bluetooth functionality makes it easier for patients (and their caregivers) to receive alerts on their smartphones the moment their blood sugar reaches a dangerous level.
