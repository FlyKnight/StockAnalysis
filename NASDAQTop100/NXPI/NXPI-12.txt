It's painful but still a strong improvement from the 49% year-to-date drop that NXP recorded in March.The recovery rested on a brighter future for car sales around the world and a generally resilient supply and-demand picture for semiconductors.I fully expect NXP to report strong second-quarter results on Monday, but the company is also likely to follow Intel's lead with sobering full-year guidance targets.
