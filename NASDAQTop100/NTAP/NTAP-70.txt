Recently, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani gave IBM a “no drama downgrade” to in-line from outperform and lowered his price target to $145 from $160 because he sees the company having a tough first half of 2020 along with fewer share repurchases because of debt.“While IBM remains an appealing asset in a Hybrid First era and >4% dividend yield will provide support, we think skewed expectations for Dec-qtr and broadly CY20 create downside risk to street estimates and keep the stock rangebound,” Evercore’s Daryanani said.
