Training neural networks is incredibly energy-intensive when done with the technology that’s available today.” A flood of new devices are getting internet connections, generating more data and increasing the need for more computing power with artificial intelligence to make sense of that new information.One example he gave Tuesday involves a technique for growing tungsten atoms in a vacuum to make more efficient connections between parts of the chip.Applied will move to 100% renewable energy and cut its carbon footprint by 50% over the next 10 years, Dickerson pledged.
