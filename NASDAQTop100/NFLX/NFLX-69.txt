The satellite radio expert and Pandora owner is a reasonable bet on the wider digital media market, and it comes with value-investment hallmarks such as a low price-to-earnings ratio and a modest dividend yield.There's a place in my portfolio for a ticker with these qualities, but I don't expect a whole lot of earnings growth, rising revenue, or fantastic stock returns from my Sirius position.
