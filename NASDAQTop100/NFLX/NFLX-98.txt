CEO Reed Hastings (now co-CEO after the promotion of Ted Sarandos to share the big chair) said that because the company "pulled forward" so many new customers in the second quarter, management now expects to add only 2.5 million new subscribers in Q3.This will not only soak up the minimal recovery in demand seen over the past couple months, but also put more pressure on U.S. producers to rein in their output and work through the enormous -- and still growing -- glut of petroleum in storage.
