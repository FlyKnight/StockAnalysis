As they worryingly wrote: While restaurant, travel, hospitality and retail workers were among the first to lose their jobs, layoffs have become more widespread in recent weeks, affecting engineers at Uber, advertising account executives at Omnicom, designers at Airbnb and other office employees.Therefore, I fully expect the Hispanic and African American job loss rate to decline moving forward, with the proportion of impacted white workers increasing.
