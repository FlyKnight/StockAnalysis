GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri announced on March 4 that he planned to introduce legislation that would ban all federal employees from using the app on government devices, as he said TikTok previously sent user data to China.“The use of apps like TikTok by federal employees on government devices is a risk to our network and a threat to our national security, and I’m proud to join Senator Hawley to put an end to it,” Scott said in a statement.
