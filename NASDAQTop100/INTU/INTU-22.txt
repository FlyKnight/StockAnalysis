Lastly, we prefer slowly-evolving, "boring" industries (e.g., luxury goods, pest control, elevators) over rapidly-moving, "exciting" ones (e.g., artificial intelligence, biotech, 5G), as well as everyday-use, non-durable products that generate small-ticket, repeatable transactions (e.g., toothpaste, baking soda, pesto sauce) instead of large-ticket, durable, one-time-purchase items (e.g., auto, computer).For instance, accounting and financial software provider Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) leveraged its prepayment revenue model to generate more free cash flow than net profit over the last ten years.
