Senator Cardin: "We didn't anticipate that we would still have the type of economic climate eight weeks later where small businesses can not operate at full capacity depending, of course, on what region of the country you may be located in.It's going to take a lot of work, some trial and error, but know that the intent is there, that we fully understand the crisis facing small business in America and we hope to do the very best we can to do as much good as possible and the least amount of harm as possible.
