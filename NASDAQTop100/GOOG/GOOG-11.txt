Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), parent of search giant Google, enjoyed robust gains in revenue, profits, advertising and online traffic earlier this year amid spreading government lockdowns and the global recession brought about by COVID-19.﻿﻿ Investors will want to know whether Alphabet can capitalize on those gains, especially the spike in Internet traffic, when the company reports Q2 FY 2020 earnings after market close on July 30.﻿﻿Given analysts' bearish forecasts for falling revenue and profit, this could represent a bit of good news for Alphabet during a challenging time.﻿﻿ Wall Street Journal.
