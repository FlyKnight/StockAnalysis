Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) is known for the Grand Theft Auto franchise and the popular NBA 2K basketball series, but it has a deep roster of titles, including Bully, L.A. Noire, Max Payne, Red Dead Redemption, Borderlands, BioShock, and Sid Meier's Civilization.While it might be difficult to repeat that success over the next decade, Take-Two is embarking on an ambitious strategy to increase its scale by releasing dozens of new titles over the next five years, many of these from existing franchises, which should improve the chances that these new games find a large audience and eventually grow profits.
