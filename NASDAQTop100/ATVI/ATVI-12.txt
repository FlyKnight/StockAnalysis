Wilson also called out EA's focus on growing its live services revenue, which has been the company's main growth engine in recent years thanks to the popularity of Ultimate Team in its sports titles, as well as in-game spending in Battlefield."While there are always challenges and interesting hurdles that we face delivering great interactive entertainment experiences, I would tell you, I'm very excited by what I see more so than I have been for our pipeline for a long time," Wilson said.
