COO Ganesh Moorthy said demand has risen not only for "COVID-19-related items like ventilators, respirators, oxygen monitors and ultrasound machines," but also for "a host of other hospital equipment needed for increased patient loads," as well as for "contact-free consumer and industrial products like hands-free dispensers [for] soap, water, paper and sanitizers."His comments arrived a week after Qorvo forecast its Infrastructure & Defense Products (IDP) unit, which depends heavily on base station-related sales, will grow sequentially and return to annual growth during the company's June quarter.
