“We started using Invisalign aligners to treat teens because of their busy lifestyles and to decrease the stress of typical orthodontic appointments and restrictions on families.I’ve been practicing orthodontics for 28 years and this new way is absolutely the best way!” In honor of this milestone and in appreciation of Dr. Hartsock and 2 millionth patient Kaitlynn Ratliff, Align is making a donation to a community food bank in Pikeville, Kentucky to support families in need.
