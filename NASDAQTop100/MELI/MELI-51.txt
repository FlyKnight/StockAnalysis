So, if you love seeing those beefy returns and want to show them off, you can go into the "my account," go to "cost basis," you have to go to your "unrealized gain and loss," because that goes to your current holdings that you haven't sold, and there's a little "+"next to companies that you bought several times.And while it can hurt to see, you're paying slightly more for something, the advantage of spacing those purchases over time is, you know, there are good businesses that miss earnings one quarter and wind up on sale, and it's really nice to be in a position where you can add to them.
