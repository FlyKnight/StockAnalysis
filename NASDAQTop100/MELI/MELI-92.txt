By Carolina Mandl SAO PAULO, March 26 (Reuters) - Brazilian financial startups are in talks to obtain funding and possibly new business from development bank BNDES or similar institutions now that their usual financing channels have dried up due to coronavirus-linked market ructions, an industry group said.BNDES also may give the fintechs new business by allowing them to distribute credit lines to small companies, which would have the advantage of being completely digital at a time when countries around the world are trying to limit personal contact to stop the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus.
