As early as March 16th, we determined that over 9,000 MercadoLibre employees in eight countries and across 20 offices would start working remotely, to ensure and promote social distancing norms, while maintaining on-site only the operational staff that was required to continue providing our services without disruptions.Moving on to recent trends in the fintech business, in mid-March, we also observed a deceleration in number and volume of payments processed; primarily as a result of lower foot traffic in bricks and mortar retail that use our MPOS and QR solutions.
