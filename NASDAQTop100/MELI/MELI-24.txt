By Gabriela Mello SAO PAULO, June 26 (Reuters) - Diageo Plc, the world's largest spirits maker, has doubled efforts to strengthen its presence in e-commerce channels in Brazil as the coronavirus pandemic triggered lockdowns, driving customers to drink at home, a company executive said on Friday."Consumption at home has increased significantly over the past three months, but does not fully compensate revenue lost with the closure of bars, restaurants, nightclubs and events," Diageo's managing director for Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, Gregorio Gutierrez, told Reuters in an interview.
