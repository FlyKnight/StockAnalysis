The broader index’s return on equity—a profitability measure calculated by dividing a company’s net income by shareholder equity—plunged in the first quarter of 2020, according to Goldman Sachs strategist David Kostin.Thanks to the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts and broad lending programs amid the Covid-19 crisis, the median net debt-to-earnings ratio sits at 2.1 times, the highest in at least 40 years, according to Kostin.
