To wit, the BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:BMRN) share price is 54% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market return of around 6.0% (not including dividends) in the same period.Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 2.8% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance.
