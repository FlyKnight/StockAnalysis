Thank you, Robert and we are pleased that he will remain with BioMarin through the review of BMN 270 valrox and the valve authorized marketing applications to ensure manufacturing continuity, as his successor, Greg Guyer, begins his journey with us in May coming from Bristol Myers Squibb.These three tenants infused with the talent of the most dedicated people I've ever worked with, have consistently enabled us to take research ideas rapidly through development, navigating the complexity of the regulatory approval process in a highly effective and differentiated manner to meet the needs of patients.
