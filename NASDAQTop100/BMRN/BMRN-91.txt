While recent data for its candidate to treat PNH, a severe and ultra-rare blood disorder, raised some questions, Wedbush analyst Laura Chico believes its growth prospects are still strong.Additionally, the analyst highlights improving corporate governance as well as argues that Viatris’ U.S. generic revenue and limited opioid exposure could help the company “de-couple from generic peers.” He added, “The announced combination of MYL and PFE’s Upjohn off-patent business will further grow and diversify MYL’s revenue base beyond US generics.” Given that it still boasts “one of the best generic/ biosimilar pipelines in the industry”, Stanicky’s bullish thesis remains firmly intact.
