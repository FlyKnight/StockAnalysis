-0.57% climbed 2.4% in afternoon trading, and have now advanced 6.4% amid a 3-day win streak, after BofA Securities analyst Tal Liani upgraded the networking company, citing subsiding headwinds and upcoming product cycles."When we downgraded Cisco in January, we saw several headwinds that we expected to weigh on the stock for 1-3 quarters, including tough [comparisons] from ASC606 accounting changes, M&A, campus switching, secular pressure on routing and reduced share repurchase activity," Liani wrote in a note to clients.
