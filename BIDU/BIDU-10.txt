That’s what has been underway at a research team jointly established by Tencent AI Lab  and a group of Chinese public health scientists headed by Zhong Nanshan, the country’s senior medical advisor on COVID-19, since its inception in February.While its immediate focus is on COVID-19, the lab’s long-term mission, in its own words, is to “utilize big data and AI for the screening, prevention and control, and warning of outbreaks, respiratory diseases and thoracic diseases.” Other Chinese tech giants have been taking up similar projects to contain the deadly virus.
