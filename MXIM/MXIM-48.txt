Inseego stock had already surged so far this year, up 66%, as the company was seen as a winner on the work-from-home movement from the pandemic because it sells networking devices and mobile hotspots that people use to increase connectivity and bandwidth.5G is still a relatively small part of Inseego's business, but it said in its first-quarter earnings report that it had eight 5G access launches planned with six operators, showing momentum for the new connectivity protocol in the second half of the year.
