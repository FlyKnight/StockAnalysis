On the earnings call, CEO Rodney Sacks said that he tested positive for COVID-19 in March but has made a full recovery, and that his company is going through a similar experience.The health crisis had no significant effect on the first-quarter results but the second quarter started out with a 22% year-over-year decrease in gross sales due to lower foot traffic in important energy-drink retail locations such as gas stations and convenience stores.
