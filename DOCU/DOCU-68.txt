"Much of the strong Q1 performance was driven by increased demand for eSignature from organizations that suddenly needed a way to sign and manage agreements from wherever they were," explained DocuSign CEO Dan Springer."[I]f you think about those 10,000 direct customers that came in, [a] significant portion of those came in with eSignature and in the quarters ahead, they're going to be our most fertile opportunity to cross-sell and expand their overall Agreement Cloud solution," explained Springer.
