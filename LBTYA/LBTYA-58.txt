-3.00% said on Monday that it is in talks with U.S. tycoon John Malone’s cable group Liberty Global over a possible merger of their U.K. operations, in a deal that would create a new television and mobile company with a combined value of almost £28 billion, including debt and anticipated synergies.Telefónica has been looking at options for O2 since 2016, when European regulators blocked its planned £10.3 billion sale of the mobile business to CK Hutchison 1, -0.19%, the owner of Three, on the grounds that the deal would have left the U.K. with just three major mobile-phone-network operators, resulting in higher prices and less choice for consumers.
