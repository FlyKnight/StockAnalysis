Large Wall Street banks are widely expected to reduce overall budgets and discretionary tech spending, which includes areas such as technology consulting services, business analytics, research and design and process management projects.For instance, Standard Chartered, which typically spends about $1 billion a year on technology, is preparing cuts in many areas, but also plans to invest in remote working tech, and wants to dedicate some of the money saved on travel to that, group chief information officer Michael Gorriz told Reuters.
