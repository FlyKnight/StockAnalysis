Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) has assured investors that it is still on track to deliver its 7-nanometer (nm) chips and graphics cards (GPU) in 2020 after its competitor, Intel announced manufacturing delays.On a July 28, Q2 earnings call, AMD CEO Lisa Su reassured that there were no production issues with the difficult-to-produce, cutting-edge 7-nm chip, and other GPUs saying, “We are on track to deliver strong growth in the second half of the year driven by our current product portfolio and initial shipments of our next-generation Zen 3 CPUs and RDNA 2 GPUs that are on track to launch in late 2020.” The assurance comes following Intel (INTC) stating on July 23 that it would see delays in the release of its own 7-nm chip until 2022.
